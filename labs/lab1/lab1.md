## Attack Abstract

The report depicts the campaign that was carried out by a Moroccan attack group whose objective was to gain access to internal tools and procedures of a gift card issuing company, and thus commit large scale financial fraud by distributing the illegally issued gift cards and gaining profit.

The attackers have gained access to the company's MS 365 cloud applications, on which the assets they were after were stored, clearing their path using various techniques and sub techniques to allow the smooth use of **social engineering**, and gain both **initial access** and **persistence**.

## Concluding Insights

During the work on this mapping assignment, I have learned that the preparation for the attack, the ground preparation and the reconnaissance phase are of significant importance to the actual attack itself.

Additionally, I have learned that even phases of the campaign that often seem small and short, can be broken down to several very meaningful MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, that can contribute greatly to the understanding of the attack, and potentially improve the defense.
